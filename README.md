# Welcome to VR for language learning!

This is a basic HTML and A-Frame project that we built to create an immersive experience for language learners. ‚ú® This project is built mainly on HTML, but A-Frame makes use of some basic JavaScript. Additionally, we used a bit of CSS to add some aesthetic changes to the home page. You can 'remix' this project (aka, make a copy and edit it) on Glitch to make it your own. You add your own assets, such as video or images, or even audio. The sky is the limit. ü¶Ñ

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That's this file, where you can get a glimpse of what the whole project is about.

‚Üê `Assets`: A series of videos that create an immersive storyline of four people sharing a meal and a semi-formal business meeting at a restaurant in Argentina.  

‚Üê `index.html`: This is the main web page for this project, the home page of the website that homes the project. 

‚Üê `several .html files`: Each of these files host a short video that is part of the immersive experience 

‚Üê `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. 

‚Üê `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript. The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads. This project so far has not active JavaScript outside of the html code.

Open each file and check out the comments (in gray) for more info.

## Make this project your own üöÄ

This project was envisioned as a template for other people to create their own immersive experiences for language learning. Currently, this is an alive (constantly changing) demo made in Spanish for advanced learners of Spanish to notice and reflect on dinner etiquette in a restaurant in Argentina. 
You can change the videos by uploading your own, or videos you found online; you can also change the options displayed after every video by just typing different information in the html code.
